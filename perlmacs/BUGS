Known problems with Perlmacs:

Crashes after repeatedly evaluating Perl code and calling
`perl-destruct'. (maybe fixed)

After `M-x perl-load-file t/40_error.t': panic: restartop

Error context reporting does a full stack trace instead of a simple
Carp::croak.

Scalar leaked after error in "use Blah;". (maybe fixed)

Circularity in backtrace_list causes Pmacs to hang in garbage
collection (uninterruptible by ^G). (maybe fixed, but very spooky)

Compiler warns about incompatible pointer types in alloc.c.

`perl-eval' doesn't propagate syntax errors.  Instead, it reports them
to stderr.

`perl-destruct' error not caught by `condition-case'
