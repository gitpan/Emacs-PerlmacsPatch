Known problems with Perlmacs:

Crashes when converting circular structures.

On some machines, crashes or fails to start up when DISPLAY is set.
Perhaps only X11R5.

After `M-x perl-load-file t/40_error.t': panic: restartop (fixed?)

Error context reporting does a full stack trace instead of a simple
Carp::croak.

GCC warns about incompatible pointer types in alloc.c.

emacs-perlmacs.diff contains problematic stuff /^(Only|diff)/ Also,
Makefile.PL should chmod -R u+w emacs-20.3 after unzipping for the
benefit of older Patch programs.

Circular dependencies in Makefile:
make[1]: Circular src <- perl/Makefile dependency dropped.
make[1]: Circular src <- lib-src dependency dropped.

`make install' prints error messages from `install-info'.  This also
affects unpatched emacs-20.3.
