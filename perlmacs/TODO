Things still to be done in Perlmacs development:

Make Emacs namespace-clean.

Check for memory leaks.

Debianize.

Make type-of return something like #<perl-package Foo::Bar> for
blessed references.

Change the to_string method of Lisp foreign objects into a print
method, and implement it for Perl data types.  Every data type except
CODE should be serializable a la Storable.  For bonus points, do CODE
too, a la B::Deparse.

Find out how `describe-function' works and fix its behavior for Perl
code objects.

Eliminate Fperl_phase and Fperl_status by making the Perl interpreter
object a vector.

Add a Perl interface to the QUIT macro.
